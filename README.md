# MFCC_features_extraction
Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are a widely used feature extraction technique in audio signal processing, speech recognition, and speaker recognition.

It involves dividing the audio signal into small frames, applying a Fourier transform to obtain the power spectrum, filtering the power spectrum using a filterbank that mimics the frequency response of the human ear, applying a logarithmic compression, and finally performing a discrete cosine transform to extract the most significant spectral features of the signal. The resulting DCT coefficients represent the spectral envelope of the signal and capture important information about the shape of the sound waveform, making MFCCs an effective technique for reducing the dimensionality of the signal while retaining relevant information for human perception.
